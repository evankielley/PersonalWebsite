    <h2><acronym title='Iceberg Drift Ensemble Forecasting'>
        IceDEF
    </acronym></h2>
    <p>The aim of this project is to develop a model that predicts the
    path that an iceberg will take. Many such models have been made in
    the past but none have managed to make predictions that were 
    accurate enough on a short time-scale. To differentiate our model
    from the models of the past, we use climatogical data from 
    numerous models (not just one) to get a better representation of
    input field uncertainty. The main components that our model will 
    require as input are: wind and ocean current velocities, SSTs, 
    and initial coordinates, dimensions, and time. We hope that with 
    accurate data from the fields just mentioned that we will be able 
    to make accurate predictions; however, the project is still in the
    early stages.</p>

    <h2>Internal Wave Experiment</h2>
    <p>This project focused on studying the physical properties of 
    internal waves as they propagate along a stratified channel. The 
    experiment itself was performed at <acronym title='Memorial 
    University of Newfoundland'>MUN</acronym> in a wave tank equipped 
    with an internal wave generator. The analysis of the experiment was
    done using a technique known as <em>synthetic schlieren</em> in 
    order to visualize waves that were nearly invisible to the naked 
    eye. The results we obtained provided insight into the relationship
    between stratification and the properties of the wave however no 
    papers were published on our findings. Future work for the project 
    does exist though since the experiment can be modified to explore 
    how the waves reflect off boundaries of varying slopes. This is an 
    area that is light on previous research and has practical 
    applications for those modeling waves as they encounter coastal 
    topography.</p>
